# K-Nearest Neighbours for Binary Classification

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for binary classification tasks, focusing on two specific use cases:

1. KNN for Machine Fault Detection.
2. KNN for Cardiovascular Disease Detection.

## Features
- Implementation of KNN from scratch using scikit-learn.
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Model training and evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Visualization of training accuracy for different values of K.

## Technical Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
